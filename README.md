# Overview
This is your Azure DevOps team project and GIT repository.

Your repository contains two branches - one called ‘develop’ and another called ‘master’.  
The master branch is empty. This is because the master branch is designed to hold code that (under a managed DevOps solution) would be deployed in production.
The develop branch contains your migrated code and should be the target of any future commits.
