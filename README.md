# Overview
This is your Azure DevOps team project and GIT repository.

The contents and history were migrated from your Collection\Project originally hosted on the legacy Microsoft Team Foundation Service (TFS) 2010 in March/April 2020.  Only the folder(s) within TFS 2010 that contained any files or code have been migrated.  

As this solution replaces the legacy TFS 2010 offering, no new functionality or repositories will be offered post migration.  If you wish to take advantage of other Azure DevOps Services (e.g. Kanban Boards, pipleines, CI/CD etc.) you will need to move to a managed, licensed solution.  

Your repository contains two branches - one called ‘develop’ and another called ‘master’.  
The master branch is empty. This is because the master branch is designed to hold code that (under a managed DevOps solution) would be deployed in production.
The develop branch contains your migrated code and should be the target of any future commits.  

# Security Groups
Access to your repository is controlled by an Azure security group whose name incorporates your ITSG number.  This security group will have contributor rights within the repository - no other permissions are available.  

Example security group: SEC-ES-DA-d-54330-<'Your Repo Name'>-azure-developer
  
Any requests for access to this repository should be directed to the owner of your relevant security group for authorisation and a Remedy Request created to support the request.  

# Documentation
The  Azure DevOps Organization that hosts this team project is owned and managed by the I&A Landscape Team but they are not responsible for managing security or providing guidance on how to use this team project or the repositories within it.

However, Microsoft provide documentation on how to use Azure Repositories which can be accessed [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-gb/azure/devops/repos/?view=azure-devops)

The I&A Landscape Team do have some supporting documentation stored in SharePoint [here](https://unilever.sharepoint.com/sites/IATechDevelopersTesters/Shared%20Documents/Forms/AllItems.aspx?RootFolder=%2Fsites%2FIATechDevelopersTesters%2FShared%20Documents%2FGeneral&FolderCTID=0x012000BD59F07527E67E469D73EA1BB40B85D8) that may prove helpful with regards to their standards and practices for managed DevOps solutions.
